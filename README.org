If you want to use Emacs, but you:

1. just want to sit down and have your new text editor work well and look good /right away/, and
2. don't want the complexity, abstraction, and lack of documentation of a larger Emacs distribution or configuration framework,

then Quake Emacs is for you.

Text editors are most often used for three core tasks: *code editing*, *writing*, and *note-taking*. Quake Emacs is a single-file Emacs distribution architected around those three fundamental tasks, aiming to provide a lean, fast, focused, and complete experience for all three right out of the box, while remaining as simple and vanilla as possible, so you can use it as a great foundation for bare-metal Emacs configuration.
